                        <h1>Rebel Poet</h1>
                        <p>Kazi Nazrul Islam (Bengali: কাজী নজরুল ইসলাম, Bengali pronunciation: [kad͡ʒi nod͡ʒrul islam] (About this soundlisten),
                        24 May 1899 – 29 August 1976) was a Bengali poet, writer, musician, and the national poet of Bangladesh.[4] Popularly
                        known as Nazrul, he produced a large body of poetry and music with themes that included religious devotion and rebellion
                        against oppression.[5] Nazrul's activism for political and social justice earned him the title of "Bidrohi Kobi" (Rebel
                        Poet).[6] His compositions form the avant-garde music genre of Nazrul Geeti</p>

                        <p>Nazrul's writings explored themes such as freedom, humanity, love, and revolution. He opposed all forms of bigotry and
                        fundamentalism, including religious, caste-based and gender-based.[14] Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays
                        but is best known for his songs and poems. He introduced the ghazal songs in Bengali language[15][16][17][18] and is
                        also known for his extensive use of Arabic and Persian words in his works</p>
